**Instructions**
"main.py" takes an IFC model as an input and outputs an HTML file "index.html" and a JavaScript file "ifc_export.js" to the script directory. 

To extract the SVG data for the floor plans, the Python module *shapely* is used. Therefore, for "main.py" to run, one needs to run `pip install shapely` in the terminal.
